# Parking-Loot

Welcome to your interview 👋

## 🎯 Goal

Design a **parking lot system** using solid **object-oriented design principles** (OOP).

This exercise is intentionally open-ended — while we expect you to cover the basic requirements below, **what matters most is how you structure, design, and anticipate future changes.**

---

## ✅ Functional Requirements

Your solution should expose at least the following capabilities:

- Get the **number of remaining spots**
- Get the **total number of spots** in the parking lot
- Know if the parking lot is **full**
- Know if the parking lot is **empty**
- Know when a **specific type of spot is full** (e.g., all motorcycle spots are taken)
- Know how many spots **vans are occupying**

---

## 🧱 Assumptions

- The parking lot can hold **motorcycles**, **cars**, and **vans**
- The lot has **motorcycle spots**, **car spots**, and **large spots**
- A **motorcycle** can park in **any spot**
- A **car** can park in a **regular** or **large** spot
- A **van** can only park in **large spots**, but may **take up 3 regular spots** if no large spots are available

---

## 🧠 What We're Really Looking For

This is not just about "making it work" — we want to see:

- ✨ **Elegant, clean code**
- 📦 **Encapsulation** and **good abstraction**
- 📐 A design that's **easy to extend** (e.g., adding a new vehicle type)
- 🧪 Some **tests** (unit or integration)
- 🗂 Good **project structure**
- 📖 Clear and concise documentation (including this README)
- 🤔 Justification of key design choices (can be in code comments or README)

---

## 🚀 Submission Instructions

When you're ready:

1. Push your code to a **public GitHub repository**
2. Send the repository link to **nicolas.vanheusden@libertewatts.fr**

Thanks, and good luck! 💪
